CodeSpace Project

Web Design/resumeChallenges/index.html  -  is my Resume 10 submission for Web Design.

Some things I have not added to Resume 10, such as:
-picture element (Resume7)
-background Image (Resume7)
I did  not need or want them on this version. If these elements need to be marked they can be found in previous resume examples in my Web Design folder.

I also have not put this on GitHub Pages, but have a dedicated domain:
